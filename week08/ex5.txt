Each process gets its virtual address during the execution (it's CPU's responsibility to assign it). Physical address refers to a physical memory location and is generated by MMU (Memory Management Unit). The user can see virtual address only and use it to indirectly access physical address. How? There's so called mapping of a virtual address to a physical address.
